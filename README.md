# R Shiny App Development Project

Built a ShinyApp to visualize the data about Movie in Parks Event in City of Chicago.

In this project, I develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on Movie in Parks Event in City of Chicago 2014-2019 open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website.  

The app is available here: https://mianchun.shinyapps.io/p2_shinyapp/

Data Source: https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?category=Events.

## Project Title Enjoy A Movie in the Parks!

I have mainly three parts shown on the webapp, "EventRecords", "Statistics",and "Data", which are shown as follows.
